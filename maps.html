									<h2>Maps</h2>
									<p>Here I share all the maps I made during the GIS course. Scroll through to find something that interests you. Maps and descriptions might take some time to load. Some maps are even interactive! Maps are broadly organized by data collection type or geovisualization interface.</p>

									<h3><a href="#">Static Map
										</a></h3>
									<p><b>Global Wetland Distribution Map</b></p>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/demo1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Here you can see a simple static thematic choropleth map, created using QGIS and an open dataset. The map shows the global wetland distribution in percentage of the total country area. Data was downloaded from the UN SDG datasets, which can be found by clicking <a href="https://unstats-undesa.opendata.arcgis.com/">here</a>. Maps like this can be used to quickly display data to a general audience, because they are easy to understand. The goal of this map is to quickly display what countries have the most and the least wetlands coverage, as well as their global distribution. For this reason, a logarithmic class interval was chosen. The colour ramp is blue, which would usually not be used because blue means body of waters on a map. In this case, however, it fits the theme of wetlands well. Borders have been removed for aesthetic purposes. The Mollweide projection was used because it looks good and is relatively little distorted.</p>

										<p><b>Difference between summer and winter vegetation in Nijmegen.</b></p>

    <iframe src="https://tombossnijmegen.users.earthengine.app/view/summer-and-winter-vegetation-in-nijmegen" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									<p>Here you can see a display of remote sensing data. The slider can be used to see the difference between summer and winter vegetation levels, with brighter red meaning more vegetation. Chlorophyll is an important component of vegetation, and reflects near-infrared light very well. Thus, if there is more vegation, there is more chlorophyll and more reflection of near-infrared light. This shows up as a brigher red on the map. This data was captured by landsat 8, a remote sensing satellite. This satelite has multiple bands, and for this map bands B5, B4 and B3 were used. For winter, imagery was taken from december, january and febuary. For summer, imagery was taken from june, july and august. and rendered and displayed in Google Earth Engine. Google Earth Engine is an open remote sensing processing and displaying application, using code to call and display satellite imagery.</p>

									<p>Here you can see an interactive version of a choropleth map. In this map, users can click on the countries to see their values, as well as zoom and pan to the desired location. This map is useful for web interfaces, at it is still simple but can also provide a lot of data. Map was created using ArcGIS Online and open UN SDG data, which can be found by clicking <a href="https://unstats-undesa.opendata.arcgis.com/">here</a>.</p>

									<p>This is an ArcGIS Field Map, used for data collection and processing in the field. Users that have downloaded the <a href="https://fieldmaps.arcgis.app/">ArcGIS Field Maps mobile app</a> can add points of measurements. This data can later be viewed and analysed in the app or on the ArcGIS mobile environment. This app can be used by scientists who want an easy to use interactive field map to collect their data.</p>
